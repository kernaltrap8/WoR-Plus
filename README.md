# Mod ideas
Bugfixes:
  - Fix star power math bug when in Quickplay+ Powers mode
  - ~~Fix issue when the Quickplay+ Rank is higher than 108~~ Seemingly randomly, the game will set rank in leaderboards to `1`
  - Fix issue where if the section breakdown screen doesnt have enough sections, the game will refuse to scroll the list once scrolled fully<br>
<br>
Future additions:
  - Add custom asset loading
  - Port other game assets to WoR (GH5/BH/WT/GH3)
  - Add better support for open-notes on Guitar (HOPOs)
  - Add tap-note chord support
  - Add new chart features to GHTunes<br>
  - All powers in Quickplay+ (beta state, being worked on)
<br>
